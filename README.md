Meme Generator is a CST 205 group project created in Fall 2017. It is developed by Kara Spencer, Carlos Estrada, and Jacob Gull.

Created for our fellow lovers and creators of dank memes, Meme Generator allows users to craft their own masterpieces using meme templates, filters, and custom text. For those looking for some extra spiciness, users can also upload their own meme images as well.

To run our generator simply clone our repo to your local machine, point your terminal to the repo's directory, and run "py testmain.py" or "python testmain.py" depending on your local settings.  The GUI will then run and you can follow the on-screen prompts to generate your meme!

In the future, this program has potential for numerous expansions such as more font and image customizations.
